# Super Smash Bros. 64 — native PlayStation 2 port

This directory tree adds a **native** PS2 build of the SSB64 decompilation. The
game's C code is compiled for the Emotion Engine with the PS2Build SDK; there
is no N64 CPU/RSP/RDP emulation. libultra is replaced by a thin PS2 platform
layer, and F3DEX2 display lists are translated to GS primitives at runtime.

The N64 matching build is unaffected: all PS2 code lives under `ps2/`, and
the few edits to game sources are behind `#ifdef PLATFORM_PS2` (or are
`AVOID_UB` fixes that are no-ops for the matching build).

Current state is tracked in [PS2_PORT_STATUS.md](PS2_PORT_STATUS.md).

## Legal

- **No game data is distributed.** `baserom.us.z64`, ROM dumps, the
  extracted `assets/`/`relocAssets/` trees, generated `build/` sources and the
  asset pack `SSB64.DAT` are all git-ignored and must never be committed. You
  need your own cartridge dump; the pack is built from it locally.
- The upstream decomp repository currently has **no LICENSE file**. Until it
  has one, this port's code (which is derived from it) carries no licence
  grant either; do not redistribute builds. Third-party components used at
  build/run time: ps2sdk, gsKit, dmaKit and the IOP modules shipped by
  PS2Build, each under its own open-source licence (see the packages). `ps2/ps2_linkfile.ld` is derived from the
  ps2sdk default linkfile (AFL 2.0, credited in the file).

## Sidecar boot contract

The normal hardware contract is simple: `SSB64.DAT` lives in the same directory as
`SSB64.ELF`. The port therefore keeps the launcher's live filesystem/IOP stack for
ordinary launches instead of rebooting the IOP and trying to rediscover the device.

Examples:

```text
mass0:/APPS/SSB64/SSB64.ELF
mass0:/APPS/SSB64/SSB64.DAT

mmce0:/APPS/SSB64/SSB64.ELF
mmce0:/APPS/SSB64/SSB64.DAT

udpfs:/APPS/SSB64/SSB64.ELF
udpfs:/APPS/SSB64/SSB64.DAT
```

This intentionally follows the keep-IOP model used by sidecar-driven PS2 homebrew:
if the launcher was able to load the ELF from that filesystem, the child keeps that
same mounted filesystem alive for its adjacent DAT. The first storage authority is an actual open of SSB64.DAT through the
launcher's live filesystem service. The EE client now distinguishes legacy
FileIO/ioman (notably host-style launches) from fileXio/iomanX
(BDM/PFS/MMCE). If an iomanX sidecar is live but its fileXio RPC bridge is
missing, only that bridge is added lazily after the real DAT open fails; the
storage drivers and mounts are left untouched. Controller/card/audio services are considered only after the DAT
has opened, and storage drivers are never blindly duplicated in sidecar mode.
Controller recovery is similarly conservative: an inherited PAD RPC is used
as-is; otherwise PADMAN is tried on the launcher's live SIO2 service. SIO2MAN
is added only when the active storage transport is known not to depend on
SIO2 (for example PCSX2 host, USB, ATA, iLink, UDP or HDD). Generic massN:
launches identify their already-proven BDM transport only after the DAT opens,
so MX4SIO is never disconnected just to obtain controller support.

`--data=<directory>` remains an advanced override. Using it opts out of the normal
sidecar contract and allows the port to rebuild a separate typed data-device stack.

## Building

Requirements: the PS2Build SDK (`ps2build` on PATH), Python 3, and for asset preparation the decomp's own
extraction prerequisites (GNU make, splat; see README.md). IDO is **not**
needed.

```bash
ps2/tools/prepare_assets.sh          # once per ROM / asset change -> ps2/build/bin/SSB64.DAT
cd ps2 && ps2build build             # -> ps2/build/bin/ssb64.elf
```

Copy `ssb64.elf` and `SSB64.DAT` to the same directory and run the ELF.
The boot layer derives the launch/data device from `argv[0]` and supports
`host:`, generic `massN:` BDM mounts, explicit USB, internal ATA/exFAT BDM,
MX4SIO, iLink, MMCE, APA/PFS HDD, UDPBD, UDPFS, memory card and `cdrom0:`.

For launchers that expose a BDM device only as `massN:`, the port deliberately
**keeps the inherited IOP/filesystem alive instead of guessing that `mass:`
means USB**. Explicit transport identities such as `usb0:`, `ata0:`,
`mx4sio0:`, `ilink0:` and `udpbd:` are rebuilt from a clean IOP and then
resolved to the actual `massN:` filesystem containing `SSB64.DAT`.

The asset pack can also live on a different device from the ELF:

```text
ssb64.elf --data=usb0:/SSB64/
ssb64.elf --data=mmce0:/SSB64/
ssb64.elf --data=hdd0:+OPL:pfs:/SSB64/
ssb64.elf --data=udpfs:/SSB64/
```

This is particularly useful when the launcher lives on a memory card, since
`SSB64.DAT` is much larger than a standard 8 MiB card. For cross-device
`--data=` use, prefer a typed transport such as `usb0:`, `ata0:`,
`mx4sio0:` or `ilink0:`. A generic `massN:` data path is only usable when
the launcher has already mounted that exact BDM filesystem; `massN:` does not
encode which transport driver would be needed to recreate it.

Network modes inherit
the PS2's address from `mc0:/SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT` or
`mc1:/SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT`. UDPBD/UDPFS use their legacy unauthenticated
LAN discovery protocols, so treat them as trusted-LAN transports rather than
Internet-facing services; after discovery this port binds data replies to the
selected peer. A bare `bdm:` path is rejected because it does not identify a
transport or an existing filesystem mount.

Testing in PCSX2 (Windows helpers, default Pad 1 keyboard bindings):

```bash
powershell -File ps2/tools/run_pcsx2.ps1 -Seconds 20       # boot + print the port's log lines
powershell -File ps2/tools/goto_1p_match.ps1              # drive the menus into a 1P match
powershell -File ps2/tools/screenshot_pcsx2.ps1 -Out shot.png
```

### Build layout (`ps2/ps2.yaml`)

| target | kind | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `ssb_platform` | ee_lib | `ps2/src/*`: platform, memory, storage, input, audio, renderer, libultra replacement |
| `ssb_game` | ee_lib | the decomp's game sources (`src/`) plus the libultra parts that are pure C (gu, sp sprites, audio synthesis, libc) |
| `ssb64` | ee | `ps2/src/boot/main.c`, linked with a generated linkfile and the IOP modules embedded |

Game code is compiled with `-DPLATFORM_PS2 -DNON_MATCHING -DAVOID_UB`,
`-fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -fsingle-precision-constant`. The two libraries
are linked twice to resolve their mutual references.

## Architecture

### Threads and messages (`ps2/src/ultra/`)
`OSThread` maps onto EE kernel threads (priority `127 - pri`, stacks from
pools). Message queues keep libultra semantics (waiter lists, blocking and
non-blocking send/receive) on top of `SleepThread`/`WakeupThread`. The VBlank
interrupt drives VI retrace events and display-buffer swaps. SP tasks
(`osSpTaskStartGo`) are dispatched to the renderer (gfx) or completed
immediately (audio), and post the same SP/DP events the game waits for.

### Renderer (`ps2/src/renderer/`)
- GS: NTSC 240p, 320×240, three 16-bit (CT16S) framebuffers + Z16S; the
  texture pool uses the rest of the 4 MiB VRAM (~3.4 MiB).
- `gbi.c` walks F3DEX2 display lists (matrices, lighting, clipping against
  near/guard planes, RDP state) and emits GS primitives into a GIF DMA chain,
  batching triangles by GS state. The colour combiner is evaluated per vertex
  as `k·T + c` and mapped to GS MODULATE; lerps by texel alpha use a two-pass
  decal. The RDP blender maps to GS ALPHA/TEST.
- `texcache.c` converts N64 textures to GS formats (CI4/CI8 → T4/T8 + CLUT,
  I/IA → T4/T8 with fixed CLUTs, RGBA16 → CT16, RGBA32/IA16 → CT32), handles
  TMEM odd-row interleave, 32-bit TMEM half-word addressing and mask/clamp
  wrap semantics, and keeps textures VRAM-resident with LRU eviction keyed by
  source address + content.
- `overlay.c`: debug overlay (Select + R3): FPS, GBI time, memory by
  category, VRAM, texture and packet stats.

### Memory (`ps2/src/memory/`)
Every platform allocation is tracked per category (`ps2_mem_*`). The N64
game allocates scene heaps from "end of overlay BSS"; on PS2 all overlay
linker symbols resolve to one 6 MiB scene arena (`arena_glue.S`, generated
by `gen_arena_glue.py`) followed by the framebuffer block the game expects.

All N64 code overlays are linked statically. To keep N64 semantics, the
generated linkfile groups each overlay's `.data`/`.bss`; `syDmaLoadOverlay`
restores the overlay's initial data image and clears its bss, exactly what
the N64 DMA reload did (`overlay_state.c`).

### Assets (`ps2/tools/`, `ps2/src/storage/assets.c`)
The game reads everything through PI DMA from ROM addresses. `SSB64.DAT`
contains *virtual ROM regions*; `osPiStartDma` becomes a region lookup + file
read (a small metadata part is resident).

- relocData (2132 files): the decomp's typed sources are compiled natively
  with the EE gcc (o32 ABI, so layout matches IDO), sizes are checked against
  the ROM, and the ELF relocations are re-encoded into the game's reloc-chain
  format, so `lbreloc.c` runs unmodified.
- Endianness policy: everything the CPU reads is native (little-endian);
  **texel data stays in N64 byte order** (the converter reads it as such);
  **palettes are native u16**. `build_assets.py` fixes the places where the
  decomp's typing does not match how the data is used (mistyped script blocks,
  AnimJoint animations typed as u16 figatree data, u16/u32-typed texels,
  palettes inside u8 blobs, sequence/bank headers).
- Bitfields read from integer-encoded scripts are reversed for LE by
  `le_bitfields.py`; C-initialised structs keep declaration order.

Stage 1 (`n64prep.mk`) runs the decomp's own extractor without IDO; stage 2
(`build_assets.py`) compiles and packs. `prepare_assets.sh` runs both.

### Audio (`ps2/src/audio/`, `ps2/src/game/ps2_synth.c`, `ps2/tools/spu_samples.py`)
No RSP audio microcode runs and nothing is mixed on the EE. The game's own
sequence player and sound-effect engine run unchanged and drive libultra's
synthesizer voice API (`n_alSyn*`); only the bottom layer, `n_alAudioFrame`,
is replaced. It calls the players back at their sample times like the N64
driver, then turns the queued voice updates (start, pitch, volume ramp, pan,
FX mix, stop) into SPU2 voice registers: each of the game's 16 physical
voices is one voice of SPU2 core 1 (dry output).

Samples: all 439 wavetables of the two instrument banks are decoded from
VADPCM and re-encoded to PS-ADPCM offline. Loops are block-aligned (silence
prepended) and the loop body is unrolled and resampled by a factor ~1 so it
spans whole 28-sample blocks; the runtime multiplies the pitch by that
factor. The 4.1 MiB set lives in EE RAM and samples are copied to SPU RAM
(1.9 MiB cache, LRU) on first use. All register changes of a frame go to the
IOP as one `sceSdProcBatch` via sdrdrv.

### Input (`ps2/src/input/pad.c`)
libpad + libmtap, up to four players (multitap on port 1, or port 1 + a
multitap on port 2). One mapping table (Cross = A, Square = B,
Triangle/Circle = C-up/C-right, L1/R2 = Z, R1 = R, L2 = L, right stick = C
buttons). The left stick is rescaled to the N64 range with a dead zone.
Rumble maps to the DualShock small motor.

### Saves (`ps2/src/storage/save.c`)
The 32 KiB SRAM image is kept in RAM and flushed to the memory card by a
low-priority thread, debounced. Two slots (A/B) with sequence number + CRC;
the newest valid slot wins at boot, so a torn write never loses the previous
save. Without a formatted card, saves stay in RAM.

### Boot (`ps2/src/platform/boot.c`, `iop.c`, `storage/bootpath.c`)
Launch identity, filesystem identity and asset location are separate. The
default data directory is beside the ELF, while `--data=<directory>` can
select another device.

The IOP policy is deliberately transport-aware:

- `host:`, generic `massN:`, and bare inherited `pfsN:` mounts are kept
  alive because resetting the IOP would destroy information that `argv[0]`
  does not contain.
- Explicit USB, ATA/exFAT, MX4SIO, iLink, UDPBD, UDPFS, MMCE, APA/PFS and
  optical paths can be reconstructed from embedded drivers after a clean IOP
  reset.
- Typed BDM identities are resolved back to the matching `massN:` filesystem
  by verifying both `SSB64.DAT` and the BDM driver's transport token. This
  avoids assuming that BDM slot numbers and transport unit numbers are the
  same.
- Unknown paths are rejected; there is no "unknown means USB" fallback.

The embedded IOP stacks are:

| data path | IOP stack / handling |
|---|---|
| `host:` | inherited ps2link/PCSX2 filesystem |
| `massN:` | inherited BDM filesystem, transport-agnostic |
| `usbN:` | bdm + bdmfs_fatfs + usbd_mini + usbmass_bd_mini |
| `ataN:` | ps2dev9 + bdm + bdmfs_fatfs + BDM-enabled ps2atad |
| `mx4sioN:` | bdm + bdmfs_fatfs + mx4sio_bd |
| `ilinkN:` | bdm + bdmfs_fatfs + iLinkman + IEEE1394_bd |
| `udpbd:` | ps2dev9 + bdm + bdmfs_fatfs + SUDPBDv2 SMAP/UDPBD |
| `udpfs:` | ps2dev9 + UDPFS SMAP + ministack + udpfs_ioman |
| `hdd0:<partition>:pfs:/...` | ps2dev9 + ps2atad + ps2hdd + ps2fs, then mount on `pfs0:` |
| `pfsN:` | inherited PFS mount (partition identity is not recoverable from a bare PFS path) |
| `mmceN:` | mmceman |
| `mcN:` | base mcman/mcserv stack |
| `cdrom0:` | cdfs, with ISO9660 `;1` fallback for `SSB64.DAT` |

Real-device files are read in bounded 64 KiB requests and the boot path allows
up to roughly 20 seconds for asynchronous BDM/network media to become ready.

### Game-source changes
- `include/PR/rcp.h`: register reads/writes go through the platform layer.
- `include/PR/guint.h` + `src/libultra/gu/sinf.c`, `cosf.c`: `DU(hi, lo)`
  initialisers so the double constants are right on little-endian (identical
  initialisers on N64).
- `src/libultra/n_audio/n_env.c`: `n_alAudioFrame` excluded on PS2.
- `apply_ps2_guards.py`, `fix_missing_returns.py`, `le_bitfields.py`:
  scripted, reviewable edits (colour packing, top-of-RAM assumptions,
  unsigned-loop UB, missing returns, anti-tamper checks, LE bitfields).
- `src/ft/ftchardata.h`, `src/sys/dma.c` (overlay reset hook) and a few
  one-line fixes.

## Debugging

`ps2_log` output goes to the PCSX2 console log (`logs/emulog.txt`). These
globals can be poked from the PCSX2 debugger (addresses via `nm` on
`ps2/build/obj/ssb64/ssb64.unstripped.elf`):

| variable | effect |
|---|---|
| `gPS2GbiTrace = N` | log the next N GBI commands |
| `gPS2TexTrace = N` + `gPS2TexFlush = 1` | re-convert all textures and log N conversions with tile state |
| `gPS2CombTrace = 1` | log each distinct textured combiner setup once |
| `gPS2TlutTrace = N` | log N CI texture binds with the commands that loaded texel/TLUT data |
